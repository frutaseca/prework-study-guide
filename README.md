# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to help be a guide for students and talk about the Prework Study Guide. We learned the basics of three computer languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We created the three files and added the links from the CSS and JavaScript file and added them to the HTML file. We created our first webpage!

## Usage

The webpage has sections one for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. They each have notes that talk a little about them on the webpage. If you open the DevTools console you will see the JavaScript running and list the topics we learned from the prework along with a section that tells us which to study first.
